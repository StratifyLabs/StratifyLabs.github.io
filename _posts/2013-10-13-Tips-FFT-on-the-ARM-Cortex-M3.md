The ARM Cortex-M3 combined with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) implementation 
is a powerful, embedded digital signal processing (DSP) solution.  The ARM 
Cortex-M3 is a mid-range microcontroller architecture with clock speeds 
over 100MHz and a powerful arithmetic logic unit (ALU).  The FFT, a useful 
tool in many DSP applications, utilizes these features enabling the ARM 
Cortex-M3 to be a suitable replacement for dedicated DSP's in some embedded 
applications.

## ARM Cortex-M3

The ARM Cortex-M3 architecture is a 32-bit microcontroller architecture core.  The 
core is implemented by various manufacturers, including NXP, TI, STMicro, 
and Atmel, as microcontrollers that are competitively priced against 8/16 bit 
cores.  It offers substantial performance improvements over 8/16 bit architectures 
including various features that enable signal processing algorithms such as 
single cycle 32-bit multiply and bit reversal instructions as well as separate 
data and instruction busses.  The FFT makes frequent use of both the multiply 
and bit-reversal instructions as well as takes advantage of the separate busses.

## FFT

The FFT is an algorithm, or more accurately a family of algorithms, that implement the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in a "fast" way--hence the name.  The FFT re-uses calculations to provide faster computing times but sacrifices a small amount of accuracy in doing so.  It turns out there are many uses for a fast approximation of the DFT.

## FFT Applications

The FFT is used frequently in both audio (and other one-dimensional signals) and 
image processing applications.  The FFT allows a signal to be analyzed in the 
frequency domain rather than the discrete time domain.  The following graph 
shows a signal in the time domain (top) as well as the frequency domain (middle 
and bottom).

The above graphs use the following equation for the time-domain representation:

This signal represents the number five using dual-tone multi-frequency 
encoding (DTMF)--that is, the sound you hear when you are on a phone call and 
press the number five.  When looking at this signal in the time domain as 
compared to the frequency domain, it is much easier to decipher the tone looking 
at the frequency plot, hence the usefulness of the FFT.

In the frequency plot (middle above), there are four spikes.  The spikes on the 
left represent the frequencies at 770Hz and 1366Hz (the bottom plot zooms in on 
these spikes).  The spikes on the right are a mirror image of the aforementioned 
frequencies.  In fact, the FFT always mirrors all frequencies below half the 
sampling frequency (see Nyquist Rate for more information).

Image processing also uses the FFT.  Consider the images below.  The one on the 
left is the original while the other has had an edge detection algorithm applied.

Edge detection is done by using an operation called convolution.  A filter matrix 
is "convolved" with an image to produce the edge detected image.  Because 
convolution is computationally intensive in the time domain, frequency domain 
multiplication can be used instead to reduced the number of operations 
performed.  This means, rather than convolving, the following steps are taken:

- first the FFT is applied to the image and the filter,
- the image and the filter are multiplied,
- finally, an inverse FFT is applied to the result in order to get the edge detected image.  

Despite being more steps, this approach actually uses much less computing power 
than convolution.  However, convolution is much easier than an FFT to implement 
in code.  The code sample below helps to bridge that gap.

## FFT Code

The code below is a snippet for performing an FFT.  ARM provides a DSP library
as part of the Cortex Microcontroller Software Inteface Standard (CMSIS).

{% highlight CPP %}
typedef struct {
  int32_t real;
  int32_t imag;
} fft_i32_t;
 
void core_fft_i32(fft_context_i32_t * context, fft_i32_t * dest, fft_i32_t * src, int sign){
  int n, k, m;
  int half_N;
  int k2;
  int twiddle;
  int twiddle_jump;
  int twiddle_max;
  int n_jump;
  int n_start;
  fft_i32_t tmp_product;
  fft_i32_t twiddle_factor;
  fft_i32_t tmp;
 
  //copy the signal input to the tmp variable
  for(n=0; n < context->N; n++){
    m = bit_reversal(n,context->order);
    dest[n] = src[m];
  }
 
        //This loop performs the FFT using the Cooley-Tukey algorithm
  half_N = context->N >> 1;
  for(k=0; k < context->order; k++){
    n = 0;
    k2 = (1<<k);
 
    //Calculate the twiddle jump and max for the stage
    twiddle_max = (1<<(context->order - 1));
    twiddle_jump = (1<<(context->order - k - 1)); //equals 2^(kmax - k)
 
    //Calculate the n jump for the stage
    n_jump = k2<<1;
    n_start = 0;
 
    for(twiddle = 0; twiddle < twiddle_max; twiddle += twiddle_jump){
 
      //twiddle value in the table (always < N/2)
      twiddle_factor.real = context->twiddle_table[twiddle].real;
      twiddle_factor.imag = context->twiddle_table[twiddle].imag * sign;
 
                        //This loop executes a single butterfly operation (size-2 DFT operation)
      for(n=n_start; n < context->N; n+= n_jump){
        m = n+k2;
        //This is the butterfly code
        tmp_product = fft_mult_i32(dest[m], twiddle_factor);  //multiply
        tmp = scale_add_i32(dest[n], tmp_product, context->scale); //accumlate
        dest[m] = scale_subtract_i32(dest[n], tmp_product, context->scale);
        dest[n] = tmp;
 
      }
      n_start++;
    }
 
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}  

## Conclusion

The combination of the ARM CM3 and the FFT allow developers to execute some 
signal processing algorithms previously reserved for dedicated DSP 
hardware.  This is possible due to the single cycle multiply as well as bit 
reversal instructions available on the CM3 and the high speed CPU cores that 
are available.  All of this functionality comes at power budgets and price 
points that are competitive with 8/16 microcontroller architectures.
