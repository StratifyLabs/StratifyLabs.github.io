An embedded microcontroller utilizes input/output (IO) signals to 
communicate with the outside world.  The simplest form of IO is 
commonly referred to as general purpose input/output (GPIO) where 
the GPIO voltage level can be high, low, or high-impedance.  Pulling 
resistors are used to ensure GPIO is always in a valid state.

### GPIO Input States on an Embedded Microcontroller

GPIO on a microcontroller is usually configured as either input or 
output.  As an input, the pin can take one of three states: low, 
high, and floating (also called high-impedance or tri-stated).  When 
an input is driven above the input high threshold, it is high 
(or logic one).  When driven below the input low threshold, the 
input is low (or logic zero).  When in a high-impedance state, the 
input level is not reliably high nor low.  To ensure an input value 
is always in a known state, a pull-up or pull-down resistor is 
used.  A pull-up resistor pulls the signal to a high state unless it is 
driven low while a pull-down resistor puts the signal in a low state unless driven high.

### Pull-up or Pull-down

The figure above illustrates a typical pull-up resistor 
application.  The resistor is connected between the power supply and a GPIO 
pin.  A switch is then connected between the GPIO pin and ground.  When the 
switch is open, there is (practically) zero current that flows from 
VCC through the resistor and into the GPIO pin.  The voltage at the 
GPIO pin is given by the following equation derived from Ohm's law:

V<sub>GPIO</sub> <span>=</span>  V<sub>CC</sub> \-  I<sub>R1</sub>\*R1

Since there is no current through the resistor I<sub>R1</sub>=0, there 
is no voltage drop across R1 making the voltage at the GPIO input equal 
to VCC which causes the input to read "high".  When the switch is closed, 
the GPIO pin is connected directly to ground driving it "low".  As a side 
effect of closing the switch, current flows through the resistor according 
to the following equation (also from Ohm's law):

I<sub>PULLUP</sub> = V<sub>CC</sub>/R<sub>PULLUP</sub>

In some systems, I<sub>PULLUP</sub> is a significant amount of current through 
the pull-up (or pull-down) resistor.  Increasing the value of the resistor can 
reduce this current while simultaneously causing the pull-up or pull-down to be "weaker".

### Weak or Strong Pull-up/Pull-down Resistor

A weak pull-up/pull-down resistor typically has a value of tens or hundreds 
of kilo-ohms.  Strong pulling resistors have values of a few kilo-ohms 
and can override weak pulling resistors if both are used on the same 
microcontroller GPIO pin.  The circuit below shows a GPIO pin with a 
weak internal pull-up resistor--most modern microcontroller designs 
have built-in pull-up and/or pull-down resistors on each GPIO pin--and 
a strong external pull-down resistor.

In order for the strong pull-down resistor to work properly, it must be correctly sized.  
During normal operation, the voltage at the GPIO pin must be below the input low 
voltage V<sub>IL</sub> as specified in the electrical characteristics section of the 
device's datasheet.  The voltage at the GPIO pin is calculated using a voltage divider:

V<sub>GPIO</sub> = V<sub>CC</sub> \* R1 / (R2 + R1)

The value of the strong pull-down must be low enough to make V<sub>GPIO</sub> < V<sub>IL</sub>.  
This ensures the voltage at the microcontroller GPIO pin is low (logic zero) 
when the switch is open.  When the switch is closed, the signal is driven high--not 
because of the internal pull-up resistor but because it is directly connected to VCC.

### Conclusion

Pull-up/pull-down resistors are a great way to prevent microcontroller GPIO inputs 
from assuming undefined values in embedded designs; however, they must be correctly 
sized (either weak or strong) based on power consumption requirements as well as 
existing circuitry (such as internal pull-up/pull-down resistors) to ensure proper 
circuit operation.
